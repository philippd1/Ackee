# Ackee-Slim

Ackee-Slim is based on "[Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee)" with everything removed that seemed unnecessary (for my usecase 😆).
Dockerfiles were updated and the entire project cleaned up a bit.

## 🏃‍♂️ Setup

1. rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your own details
2. start with `docker compose up`
